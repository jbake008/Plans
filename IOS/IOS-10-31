MATH CLASS CONTINUED

Reasearched ways to perform multiple operations in a row. Will attempt to
implement these methods to create multiple operation functionality.

DESIGN: 
  Black background -> White background
                   -> All GUI elements black/blue color

Create functionality to perform multiple operations from a user generated one
line of entered text. 
EX: 5+7/5*89
Function will perform the operations in the order entered. 
If addition is before multiplication, addition will be performed first. (No PEMDAS)


IOS-9-24 Continuing Multiple Operations
IOS-9-17 Program has the functionality to perform two digit operation
IOS-9-10 Program has the functionality to determine numbers from mathmatical operators
IOS-9-3 Single digit mathematical operations working.
